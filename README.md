# Movie-recommendation-system-
This project implements a Movie Recommendation System using various recommendation techniques in Python. By analyzing movie data, user ratings, and metadata, we aim to provide personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences.

ðŸ“Š Project Overview:
    The objective of this project is to create a robust recommendation engine using multiple approaches:

Content-Based Filtering:
       Recommending movies similar to those the user has liked in the past.
Collaborative Filtering:
       Recommending movies based on the preferences of similar users.
Hybrid Approach: 
      Combining both techniques for more accurate suggestions.
ðŸš€ Key Features:
Content-Based Filtering:
       Recommendations based on movie metadata such as genres, cast, director, and keywords.
       Uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to identify the most relevant features of each movie and suggest similar content.
       
Collaborative Filtering:
       Implements Matrix Factorization using the Surprise library for collaborative filtering based on user ratings.
       Utilizes techniques like SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) to predict the ratings a user would give to unseen movies.

Hybrid Recommendation System:
       Combines content-based filtering and collaborative filtering to create a hybrid system that provides well-rounded recommendations.
      Offers better accuracy by integrating both user behavior and movie features.
      
Evaluation Metrics:
       Performance evaluation using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) for rating prediction.
       Cross-validation techniques to ensure the robustness of the model.
       
Interactive Movie Search:
      Allows users to input movies they like and get personalized recommendations in return.
      Utilizes both genre similarity and user ratings to enhance the quality of recommendations.
ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies:
Python: 
    For the overall project implementation.
Pandas & NumPy:
    For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Scikit-learn:
    For content-based filtering, feature extraction, and similarity calculation.
Surprise Library: 
    For collaborative filtering and implementing matrix factorization models.
NLTK:
    For natural language processing tasks in the metadata (e.g., parsing genres, directors).
Vs code: Used to showcase the project and explain each step of the recommendation process.
ðŸ“‚ Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is sourced from MovieLens, which contains millions of user ratings and metadata for thousands of movies.

ðŸ“ˆ Business Insights:
This recommendation engine can be leveraged by streaming platforms, e-commerce sites, or any media provider to suggest relevant content to users.
By analyzing user preferences, businesses can increase engagement, improve user satisfaction, and drive content consumption.
